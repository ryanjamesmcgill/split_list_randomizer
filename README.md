# split_list_randomizer
This web application was made to support a system that engineering scientists used to run processing experiments in a mass production semiconductor fab. The system required the engineers to manually generate strings of numbers according the split condition they desired. The manual component became a huge time sink for the staff so this website was made to quickly generate the required random strings. Rather than simply use a pseudo-random number generator, this application uses <a href="https://www.random.org/">random.org</a>'s API which generates data based on true random atmospheric noise.
